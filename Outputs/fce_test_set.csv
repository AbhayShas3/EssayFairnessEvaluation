          I am very happy to know that I have won the first prize in youyour competition. I am writing in order to give you all the details that you need from me.
          First of all, I would like to travel in July because I think California is better in Summer. Regarding accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because cabins seem to be more comfortable than tents. According to your letter, I will be able to take part in two activities at the Camp. Let me tell you that I would like to sing and play tennis. As a matter of fact, I am very good at both of them.
          Finally, I would like you to tell me if I will need some special clothes. If the answer is yes, could you tell me whichwhat kind of clothes I will need. One other thing, it would be useful to know if I will need to take with me some extra money. If the answer is yes, could you tell me how much money I will need to take with me.
          I look forward to receiving youyour reply.

          I am writing to you to complain about the musical show Over the rainbow. My wife and meI went to The Circle Theatre last Saturday evening because we love the main actor, Danny Brook. We felt very disappointed when we discovered that Danny had been replaced by an unknown and really bad actor.
          The show should have started at half past seven but we had to wait for forty-five minutes without any kind of explanation.
          Not only was the show late and awful but it was expensive too. The advertisement said there were discounts available but when we arrived there the woman who sells the tickets told us the discounts were only available on Monday evenings.
          Despite the terrible evening we decided to go to the theatre restaurant to relax and have dinner, but we found it was closed because its floor was being repaired.
          As you can see it wasn't a perfect evening at all!
          That is why I am writing to you. I want you to give us our money back because the things published in your advertisement aren't true. There should be no problem as I still have the tickets.
          I look forward to hearing from you.

          I'm writing to you now because I've been told that is going to be read on the radio a short story by Agatha Christiea short story by Agatha Christie is going to be read on the radio. It will be the followingnext Sunday on the local station at five o'clock in the evening.
          It's a story titledentitled Accident, and I think you'll enjoy it.
          The story is about the life in a small village. The main character is a retired police inspector who recognises a woman.
          That woman is supposed to have killed her husbands (at least two), because she wanted their money.
          The policeman lets her know he has discovered her and he won't allow another crime. He threatens to tell her husband what she had done. However, she's a very clever woman and she doesn't look worried.
          In the end, the three of them are having a cup of coffee and one of the cups contains a terrible poison. There will be a horrible accident in a few seconds.

          To Helen Ryan,
          Hello, how are you? I'm fine. Thank you for the letter. I got it today and couldn't believe it! As youYou asked me for some further information. I will write it down.
          I'd like to travel in July and this is the only time I can travel, because I am busy with a school project until the end of June and I am going to work in a hospital for the summer holidays in August and September.
          For accommodation, I prefer log cabins, because I believe I can meet more people if I stay in log cabins and it's a lot of fun to talk with them.
          I'd like to play tennis and basketball while I am there. I have never played basketball, but I have played tennis for 6 years and I am a good player.
          I have never traveledtravelled abroad and don't know if I should bring a credit card with me. If you have suggestions, can you write to me again?
          Thank you again and take care,
          Yours sincerely, 13 June, 2000.
          Dear Kim,
          Hi! How are you doing? I'm fine. As you asked me about the concert, I'll write about it today.
          First of all, we cleared all the seats. There were so many seats that it took a long time to finish clearing. Before the concert started, we sold some snacks and drinks and after that, we stood in front of the audience to prevent them from moving forward. During the concert, all the fans try to get closer to the singers, jumping, shouting and so on and some of them faint when they get totoo excited. We move them to a safe place so that they won't be kicked or stepped on by other mad fans.
          By the time it finished, I was exhausted, but I certainly enjoyed this experience as you can meet many people at a time and what I liked most was that you can see famous stars very close and listen to their live music for free!
          Have you had an interesting experience? Please write about it in the next letter.
          I hope to hear from you soon.

          Valverde. Have you ever asked yourself which lessons or activities should be filmed in the school video? Well, I've just polled some students and here are their responses.
          70% of students think we should film the Speech and Drama lesson because it is one of the lessons they enjoy the most.
          The vast majority say Maths and History should be filmed too, because they love these subjects and think they are very interesting and are also great fun.
          60% of students say breaks should be filmed too, because they want to show in the video that they can also have fun at school.
          Most of them said Science, English and Literature shouldn't be filmed because they are not very interesting and are also very boring.
          In my opinion I think basketball should be filmed too because it is one of the activities the students are very keen on doing and they usually enjoy it.
          But I don't think we should film breaks, because in my opinion everyone knows howwhat breaks are like and what students do during them.
          In a nutchelnutshell I think Maths, basketball, Speech and Drama, and History should be filmed.

          We have discussed the programme in our class and the students are very happy about that, especially because we will have the possibilityopportunity to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery.
          Last week some students ofin our class have seensaw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March.

          We think that it will be a great opportunity for us to see this show because we are all interested in fashion.
          For these reasons, I am asking you if we can go there on Tuesday'sTuesday afternoon.
          You can give the possibilityopportunity to the students tooto choose between gogoing shopping or gogoing to the show. The show will be at the Central Exhibition Hall and it will be openedopen until 7. pm.

          Yours sincerely I agree with this statement.
          I think that famous people deserve to have a private life like all the normal people, without journalists following them all the time.
          A famous person should have the chance to go on his own for a walk without having the annoying impression of being followed.
          In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private lifelives of the famous people. They should understand when it is too much, when they are going too far.
          For instance, the tragic death of Princess Diana is an example of what a journalist must not do. In this occasioninstance we can say that the journalists have, of course indirectly, caused her death.
          On the other hand, the famous people have to understand that the people are interested in their lives. If one is famous, itone has to accept also the disadvantages of bebeing famous.
          The famousFamous people must enderstandunderstand that the journalists are doing their workjob.
          In my view Prince Charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media. When he goes skiing in Switzerland he always stops for a while to talk with the journalists and to give the photographers the chance to take pictures. After this break he continues to ski without bebeing annoyed for the rest of the holiday.
          In conclusion I think that there must be more compehensioncomprehensionunderstanding and respect between famous people and the media.",13.62318992614746,low

          Many people enjoy going shoppingsshopping, meeting friends and mainly spending their money, but sometimes shopping can be a terrible experience.
          The good side of this activity is that it can be a good leisure, provided you are not in a hurry.
          On the other hand, when the shops are crowded (for instance, just before Christmas), going shopping can be very stressful, as you cannot walk freely and have to bearendure endless queues. Another problem is the shortage of trolleys in supermarkets, which is very common when they are full of people. As if thesethis were not enough, there are always impolite assistants, who make your day even worse.
          Summing up, going shopping can be a relaxing activity if you choose the right day, but be aware of how dangerous it can be for your patience.",13.84770393371582,low

          I would also like to take tennis and painting activities while staying at the camp. I've played tennis for eight years now and have competed in many matches. I take painting as my hobby as well, even though I have never tooktaken proper lessons.
          Also, can you please be kind enough to tell me what sort of clothes I should take? Would the weather be quite hot? Would you recommend me to take an extra bottle of sun block?

          Hi! How are you? Thanks for your letter.
          You want to know everything about the concert? Okay - here it goes!
          Two hours before the concert began, I arrived at the hall. God, I was so excited! Already everything was set up, the groupsgroup's instruments, lights, microphones... I quickly helped others to decorate and to 'polish' off the hall - we blew up as mymany balloons as we cancould and sprayed them with gold and silver.
          The concert went terrificterrifically, too! There must have been hundreds out there - dancing, laughing, shouting.. and I was having athe time of my life! I handed out refreshment to the pop group's members during breaks - my friends were so jealous of me!
          At the end of the concert, when it was after midnight and everyone had alreadalready left, the group came up to each of us (who helped out) and thanked us personally! I mean, isn't that really nice of them? We shook hands and they even wrote (scribbled?) their signatures on my T-shirt! I guess this was the best part of the night!
          Really, Kim, you should try this out some time. Even though I was exhausted, it was really worth it!

          Last month I helped at a pop concert. The name of the band was 'Dream Comes True'. This bankband is not only in Japan but also in the U.S.A very famousvery famous not only in Japan but also in the USA. I am still excited while I am writing to you about my experience.
          First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived. The musicmusical instruments were transported from the lorries (three big lorries!) into the concert hall and I helped to put them atin the right position on the stage. They were very heavy and I had to carry them with care because they were very important forto the band. After that I helped to test lights and microphones. I almost fainted when the band arrived and entered the stage. I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in the flesh.
          The most exciting thing about my experience was that the band spoke to me after the concert. The band was very satisfied with the stage and appreciated our work. I was so exitedexcited and happy that I can't remember what I talked with the band about.

          Facilities
          It was found that the Amusement Centre is the most popular building in Seoul to enjoy yourself. There is a wide range of facilities including theatres, game centres, Korean restaurants. In particular, the people seemed to be satisfied with the theatres, because the screen is massive. The Korean restaurants appeared to be the most popular towith foreigners.
          Things to buy
          It seemedseems you can buy everything you want inat a reasonable price in the building. EspecaillyEspeciallyIn particular, Korean souvenir shops were felt to be extremely cheap. However, you can buy luxurious things as well if you wish.
          Conclusion
          In short, the Amusement Centre is a fascinating place and it deserves a visit. I would highly recommend this building, because not only you canyou can notcannot only enjoy yourself but also experience Korean culture which might be exotic to foreign visitors.",13.925933837890623,low

          Dear Ms Clark,
          I am writing to mention my opinions on the International Arts Festival that you have organised this year. It was a great idea, but I think I need to make some points about the things that I found unsatisfactory.
          First of all, I was disappointed that the artists invited were from only six countries. Next year's festival will be much better if artists from places other than Europe and the USA take part in it.
          Secondly, despite the high quality of the concerts, some of the halls they were given in were too small for the crowd of auditionaudience. They were cold and moistdamp, too, because the air-conditioning system was insufficientinadequate.
          Thirdly, I think more plays and films should be shown next year. However, I found the idea of a single ticket for all the events of the weekend excellent, as the price was reasonable and access to a wide range of events was provided.
          Finally, I should say that I had a very good time in spite of the flaws and I would like to thank you for it. I wish to enjoy an even better festival next year.

          Dear Mary,
          I'm glad to have received your letter and I'd really like to talk about the school and family rules here.
          Firstly, the weirdest rule in our schools is that we must wear uniforms all the time. This is especially bad for us girls, as we are obliged to wear skirts and we cannot climb the stairs or run like the boys. But apart from this, I think most rules of the school are quite reasonable, like addressing to the teacher using the second plural personperson plural (it is different in Turkish) or standing up when s/he enters the class. As we are a developing country, teachers are quite respected.
          Another thing that is different from your schools is that we don't change classrooms between periods. We stay in the class in which we have been registered for the whole year, and a different teacher comes in every period.
          Let me talk about the rules at home. We like chatting on the phone so much that most of us'our parents have limited the talking time down to five minutes, threatening to cut off the wires otherwise. Also, as most of us live in flats, we're not allowed to listen to loud music or run or play ball games in the house! But we are legally allowed to play instruments like the piano until 10 p.m.
          I'd love to write more, Mary, but I'm in a real rush nowadays. This month has been full of exams and there are still onessome coming up next week, so I must be a swot as you see. Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing your comments about our rules.

          I am writing to complain about the musical show advertised in your latest leaflet.
          First of all, I would like to say that it was the worst performance I had ever seen and it disappointed me very much.
          Although your advertisement stated that the main actor would be Danny Brook, it was not him and a different man appeared, who was not prepared for the role.
          Secondly, youyour advertisement stated that the second show should start at 19:30. ItThis was not true because the audience had to wait until 20:15.
          Then, I did not get a discount and I had to buy a full-price ticket, although I am not an adult yet.
          Finally, I was hungry after waiting for the show and wanted to order something to eat. ItThis was, however, impossible because the theatre restaurant was closed for unknown reasons.

          She heard from her friend Jon that Paul, the worst pupil at school, had thrown an enormous frog inside the desk of Miss Colston, their English teacher.
          Miss Colston was an old woman, who wanted her pupils to understand and admire English novels and poems.
          But the children were bored during her lessons and Paul was very disappointed that she didn't read any funny stories.
          So he decided to scare the old woman away from school. Now he thought it was stupid to tell Jon about it, as he was the best friend of Pat. ""Oh, that girl will cause some problems"" - he thought when Miss Colston entered the classroom. She approached the desk and wanted to open it, but suddenly Pat shouted - ""Miss Colston, please, don't do that. There's a frog"". The teacher stared at the whole class and calmly whispered - ""Who did it?""

          Anyway, I really enjoyed helpyinghelping at a pop concert last month so that I'd like to write them downabout it!
          First, we went to this office to apply for this job. The interview was OK and my friend and I waswere hired!
          Then, the day of the concert came! Can you imagine how excited we were? Our hearthearts waswere bumpingthumping and we were kind of nervous, however, there were a lot of things to do, so we started working.
          After working 30 minuteminutes, a singer appeared. While we were organizing the concert, she was singing on a stage. We could listen for free! I just imagined what it was like to be a singer. If only I could sing beautifully!
          Anyway, by the time we finished everything, thusandsthousands of funsfans came ininto this concert hall. Everybody looked very excited about the concert.
          During the concert, we had to stand to protect this singer. We saw some very strange fans but most of them were quite nice. Actually, they were well-behaved.
          Finally, the concert finished and we were thanked by this singer. Also, we got some posteresposters as well.
          It was a great experience for me and my friend. I wish you werehad been there with us! Maybe next time!
          By the way, I think I should go. Please take care and please write to me, right?
          Love,

          I am writing to you in reply to your letter.
          First of all, I want to givethank you the thanks for this prize. I am very excited because I have never won a prize. I have never been into the USA, so I think that this traveltrip will be an unforgetableunforgettable experience.
          Secondly, I willwould like to tell you that I can only travel in July because in June I have to take my final exams at school. In August I have to be in Madrid because I am going to work as a trainee in a travel agency. After augustAugust I must return to school, so I can only go to California in July.
          I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like very much the naturenature very much, and camping, so I think that I will be better in a tent than in a log cabin.
          Although all the activities that you mention are very interesting, I prefer swimming and tennis. I think that I am very good inat swimming. I won a local competition when I was seventeen. I am not so good inat tennis because I began to play only two years ago. Finally, I would like to ask you how the weather will be in July and whichwhat kind of clothes I have to wear. Furthermore, I would like to know the money that I have to take and whichwhat amount of money is normally spent in the camp. I look fowardforward to receiving your reply.
          Yours sincerely,
          Silvia Torroja. In my opinion the statement 'Shopping is not always enjoyable' is totally true.
          An argument in favour of this statement is that shopping is very tiring. You can be walking for hours and finally you can't find anything that you like.
          Also, you can spend hours trying to decide between a wonderful blue pair of trousers or a beautiful black dress, for example.
          I think that shopping is even more boring when you go with a friend and you have to give her some advice. It can be a very stressful situation because in some momentssometimes you don't know what to say.
          In my opinion shopping could be a 'dangerous' activity because you may spend more money inon some clothes thatthan you can afford. I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping. Despite shopping isbeing boring, I think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several clothesitems of clothing and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment.
          So, shopping is not enjoyable, but necessary.",14.70125675201416,low

          I am writing to tell you something about the three-day trip to London.
          I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip. Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it. Personally, I enjoy looking at and learning about new inventions and all the science. That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea. However, my class and I have seen an advertisement aboutfor a fashion and leisure show. We are attracted to this show and would like to go. Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum.
          This show is on the 14th March. It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and will start andat ten o'clock and finish at five o'clock in the evening. Apparently, this show is free to all students, which means if we went, the cost of the trip willwould be cut downreduced.
          I think it is a great opportunity because it is based on fashion. We like to keep up with the ragetrends but I think it will help those who want to become a fashion designerdesigners later on.
          I have a suggestion on how the programme could be changed. The shopping time could be after the show and the free time exchanged for the science museum. If we go to the show, we can do without the free time.
          Please give this your careful consideration..
          Yours sincerely, In a country like the UK, we are all bound to have houses. We either own it, or we simply borrow it from other people. We take our homes for granted. Think about the people in the poor countries! They struggle to survive. However, as we approach the future, our homes will start to change.
          Have you ever thought about how the changes will affect our lives? I doubt it.
          There will be lots of differences in our homes of the future from our homes now, but there may also be a lot of similarities. For one, the future homeshome might not be built out of bricks at all! It may be built out of a stronger substance or a more attractive one, such as glass. Non-breakable glass. Also, due to global warming, sea levels might rise and the risk of flooding will also rise. Therefore, houses will be built on high supports. All domestic appliances such as showers, kettles, lights, TV and curtains may be voice activated. Incredibly high security will prevent robbery.
          The future homes will also have many similarities, such as having a separate bathroom, and not having one in a bedroom, or having two floors or having garages.
          It has been a pleasure sharing my thoughts with you. What do you think will happen in the future?",14.95168113708496,low

          I have just received your letter in which you inform me that I won the first prize of two weeks at Camp California. I am very excited about it!
          I would like to travel onin July, since I am studying and that is the only month I have foron vacation. Fortunately, I have heard that the weather is beautiful in California during that month. I'd rather sleep in a tentstent because I want to enjoy this wild experience! I will take my sleeping bag with me, just in case.
          I would love to participate in the singing and photography activities. Singing is something I have enjoyed since I was a little child. In fact, I took some singing lessons. I am not very good at photography but I want to make an album to share it with my family when I come home.
          Could you please tell me what kind of clothes do you recommend for the camping? How much money will I need? Is it better to take cash or a credit card?
          Thanks for your attention.
          Cordially yours, Shopping is not always enjoyable
          The best way to go shopping is when you thinkto think in advance about what you really want to buy and you know how much money you estimate to spend. If people would think about it BEFORE going shopping, they would not have a headache when they go home and realize they did not want what they bought.
          Shopping can be an awful adventure when people want to buy all their presents the day before Christmas, for example. There is no way to find good prices! Shops are crowded, items are of bad quality and people are buying without thinking.
          The worst time to go shopping is when people feel under stresspressure or when they feel unsatisfied in their personal lives. It may seem relaxing at the beginning, but if they take their credit cards with them, the stress will increase when they have to pay for the bills!!
          Recommendations?

          Hi! I'm writing to tell you about my experience at the concert.
          It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the leader of itsinger fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark. The fans started shouting and wistlingwhistling for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened. Then, a security guard started calling for help. I happened to be near him, so I went to help him. He asked me to help Bono, the leadersinger, get up and to get him some water. I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him. There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger. LikeAbout an hour later, he recovered and the show began.
          What I liked was that I had the chance to help my idol and to talk to him.

          I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"", of wichwhich you are the manager. I would like to say that there were many problems with the musical show.
          The first problem concerned the main actor ofin the show. Although it was written in the show's addvertisementadvertisement that the main actor was Danny Brook, it, unfortunately, was not him.
          The show was supposed to have started at 19:30, but it only started at 20:15, so the publicaudience, including me, was forced to wait for fourty fiveforty fiveforty-five minutes.
          It was also written in the show's addvertisementadvertisement that there would be discounts available foron the tickets. However, there waswere not any.
          The fourth problem concerned the Theatre Restaurant. Even though the addvertisementadvertisement said we should visit it after the show, it was closed and no explanations were given.
          In conclusion, the addvertisementadvertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so I would like to ask for my money back.
          I would like to hear from you in the near future.

          Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. IIt all happened a year ago, when Pat and I were still best friends and used to tell each other everything.
          One day, I inocentlyinnocently told Pat that I was dating Philip Smythe, the school's hunk and most popular boy. I asked Pat not to tell anyone, and she promised me she wouldn't. I believed in her and trusted her blindly.

          The next day, I went to school and found out that Pat had told everybody that I was dating Philip. Suddenly, an enourmousenormous saddnesssadness caught me, because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone, so he would definatelydefinitely brakebreak up with me, and I knew I was going to stop talking to Pat, because she had just ruined my happiness and I couldn't trust her anymore.

I really do understand that problems can always come up but it would not have been a problem for me as long asif I had been informed about it.

Even though it was my first one I managed and I got to know pretty fast the way they workthe way they work pretty fast. Now, I'm just fascinated by the Internet and I spentspend at least half an hour every day surfing the net, visiting lots of webswebsites and getting all kindkinds of information for free.

          I should not forget mobile phones. If I feel like talking to a friend I just have to call him and whereeverwherever he is I will be able to get through to him. Several europeanEuropean companies like Nokia or Ericsson are focusing on mobiles and I have been told that in a couple of years it will be possible to send andan e-mail either from thea computer or from thea mobile, which is going to be great.

          There is no doubt that fashion affects people and makes them obsessed with this subject, but what can be designed moremore can be designed? Can you imagine thea trend which willwould be as shocking as it has never been?
          The clothesClothes isare part of each culture and one of thesethose things which expressesexpress our taste and personality. People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary, feel comfortable and stand out. They come up with many ideas but it can't last for a long time. Nowadays, it's getting obvious that designers soldsell only details, butand significant changes don't turn up. Styles mix, colours and shapes come back from the past, and only the fabrics are different.
          People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time. Teenagers are bored with casual fashion and their parents laugh at them because of the fact they wear commonordinary clothes. That's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to omitavoid the boredomeboredom. I am sure that at lasteventually we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free there. There won't be any problem with being up-do-date.

          Chi Chen Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money foron yourself or people you appreciatelike is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare.
          You often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the alleysaisles to take a look at a product. After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is out of priceoverpriced. Frustrated, you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers. There, you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to staystand up even though your tired legs demand a seat. It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the hypocritalhypocritical cashier.
          Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer but, unluckilyunfortunately, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for. Instead, you keep thinking about the initial product you could not afford, resulting intoin more frustration and tiredness.
          So there are several plausible reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable.",36.48100662231445,high

Believe me, you would never guess who the killer is! There is also Hercule Poirot, the famous detective, and he finally solves the misterymystery. But I will not tell you any more. You have to read it yourself. And if your cousin likes crime stories it is a perfect book!
          Unfortunately it is quite expensive, £32. But do not worry about the price because your cousin will love it!
          Okay, I hope to have news from you very soon. Have a good time.

          About the information you asked me for, the most suitable month for me to travel would be July, since it is when I am free for travelingtravellingto travel due tobecause I won't have classes at school by that time. InAs to the matter of accommodation I'd rather prefer a log cabinslog cabin, because I consider them better for resting and getting knowto know people.
          I also want to mention that it's great you have so many activities. The ones I consider I'm good at are painting and photography. I love nature and I'd like to record the Californian landscapes.
          I have something I'd like to ask you. Do I have to take any special clothes with me? How warm is California in thosethat daysmonth? Another thing, should I have to taketake my camera with me for the activity at the Camp? I'd appreciate any further information you can give me.

          I'm writing to you to complain about the disappointing expirienceexperience I had with your theatre.
          First of all, I arrived at about 19:20 because the advertisement said that performance begins at 19:30, but it wasn't till about 20:15 that the beginbegan of the showshow began and I had to wait an entire hour, which was not very amazingamusing.
          Secondly, I was supposed to haveget a discount but there were no discounts, although the advertisement said there are.
          Thirdly, the disappointment made me a bit hungry but the restaurant was closed without any sign saying why.
          And at last, the most disappointing pointthing, the advertisement againalso said that there would be Danny BrookDanny Brook would be there, my favoritefavourite actor, but there was someone else instead of him.
          So, the show was not good at all and my evening was spoiled in spite of all that the advertisement promissedpromised. As things went that way, I want my money back.
          Sincerely Yours, I shall have a look intoat the place I believe no one can avoid - the kitchen.
          How much effort and time it took about two decades goago to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat, and modern coffee machines can make eveneven make a cappuccino or whatever you want on their own. Those devices madehave made our life easier likeas old fridges had to be defreezed to melt outdefrosted and new fridges use a different kind of cooling system and will tell you if youryou forgothave forgotten to close the door! The modern cooker will turn off itselfitself off if something goes wrong! Personally, my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to the devices modern technology offers us.",37.519256591796875,high

          E. Sidorov. I enjoy shopping like any woman. It is amazing and sometimes amuzingamusing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is. And still even this strong spell can be easily shattered. Who can prevent me from having a good, though probably not for my purse, time in the magic world of shopping? The assistant of evil power which frustrates the long-looked-forward-to spell is a shop assistant. Or I would rather say he or she might be or might happen to be such. It's all very nice to be met by a helpful assistant with a radiant smile, ready to help you. But sometimes I really get annoyed at his or her, persistent in nature and polite in structure, questions or suggestions. To say nothing about his or her giving advice! I always make my own decisions! Like any human being I am not delighted to feel guilty, especially when I am not. But I do feel ill at ease when I see dissappointeddisappointed or angry assistants' faces on leaving the magic world without any remembrancessouvenirs of it!",38.096710205078125,high

          Dear Sir,
          I am writtingwriting this letter because I am very dissapointeddisappointed with your musical show. I recently went to London on vacation, with some friends. We were told that this was a great show, and we decided to see how it was. If the show was as good as we were told we should save our final night for it, this was going to be the end of our vacation, a great one, by the way.
          When our final day arrived, we went shopingshopping in the morning and then we went to the hotel to change our clothes and get ready for the show.
          When we arrived, thethere were a lot of people, the paceplace was beatifulbeautiful, all seemed perfect. When we entranceenterentered the place our problems begunbegan. First, there were no discountdiscounts on the tickets but that was fine. Then, the show had a great delay, almost an hour,; we dealdealt with that too. After that they changed the principal actor, the one that replaced him was very bad, that made us realyreally angry. But that isn't all, to complete this tragedy the restaurant was closed.
          I hope that you understand thatwhy I want my money back, or at least some of it, because this weren'twasn't my ""perfect evening out"" How has modenmodern technology changed my daily life? I think that technology havehas changechanged my life and everybodieseverybodyeverybody's life in many ways. Nowadays, technology is everywhere, all over your house, your school, oficeoffice or any place you can be in a city. This technology has helphelped to mademake my life easier and more exciting, but like everithingeverything it has had some negative thingaspectaspects.

          The bad thingsconsequences that this could have are unimportanunimportant, in comperisoncomparison with all the good things thisit havehas done, so let's don'tnot focus on the negative aspects of it.
          I think technology has become a part of our lifeslives, so we have to learn how to live in this new world, thatwhich is changing as fast as computers change. This is a new era, an era for a new tipetype of people, the feutafuture people",38.11590576171875,high

          The reason for which I decided to write you a letter, will, I guess, surprise you. I hope you will not feel offensedoffended, but I really neededneed to contestcomplain about your theatertheatre.
          I was present at your musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". ItI was very excited thinking about being at the theatre, and I thoughthought with certainty I was going to enjoy my evening.
          Plus, I felt very pleased when I heard that Danny Brook was part of the play: he used to be an old friend of mine in Highschoolhigh school and perchanceperhaps I havehad found him back here! You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not playingperforming and I was more bewildered that nooneno one made an apologieapology for it! How rude!
          Moreover;, it was written that the show was supposed to start at 19.30; it actually started at exactly 20.15! 45 minutes latterlater: where we had nothing to do, but waitingwait. We couldn't even have a drink, because, obviously, the restaurant you talked about was closed!
          Really, what a mess inwith the administration. Although, I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket, as you mentionnedmentioned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, these couldn't possibly be reachedgiven either! I am sure you are smart enough to think of paying me back, so you do not lose a faithful clientcustomer.
          Sincerely yours, If more and more ingenorsengineers work onin science and technology, it must be thatbecause it is really usefulluseful: but in what particular way?
          For my part, I know it would be such a pain in my neckpain in the neck. The more I think of it, the more I realise I use modern technology a lot. I guess I could not live without manylots of instrumentsdevices.
          The first thing I think of is the internetInternet. What a great invention! It allows me to learn anything without having to travel throughto manylots of libraries as I used to do. It also makesallows me writeto write to my friends by e-mail. I did not to writewrite at all to peopleto people at all until I havehad got on the internetInternet. ByWith this procedure, you only type and send, no need to goinggo to the post-officepost office!
          Of course this is just because I am lazy, I actually could force memyself a little, and then go to the library and to the post-officepost office, but the internetInternet just makes it easier!
          I am also very fond of cell-phones. These are also such a relief. I can go anywhere without being nervousworried about the fact, that maybe someone is trying to reach me!
          Modern technology changed my daily life by making it easier and by turning me into a lazy woman. Nevertheless, this easy life has then offered me the chance to be more peacefulrelaxed and I think it is essential.

In the end I was very disappointed. Firstly, the show did not start on time but fourty-fiveforty-five minutes laterlate. This made me a little bit angry because I already had troublestrouble with buying a ticket beforeearlier: although it was proclaimed in the advertisement, there were no £15 and £10 discounts available. But I did not mind anymore because I knew that a show with Danny Brook would be worth this. That was why I was really shocked recognizingto recogniseto see that there was another actor playing his role. This actor was not almostnearly as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paiedpaid so manymuch money if I had known this before. At the end of the musical I decided to ""rescue"" this evening by visiting your theatre restaurant. Like everything else that had gone wrong that evening, the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill! I hope you can see that this was no ""perfect evening"" and I was very disappointed, mostly because this was the last night of our stay in London.

          I heard somebody say, ""Exciting books always describe people in difficult situations"". Well, I would not agree that this statement is always true, but it is true in the case of the book ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway.
          The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular: an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea, fighting with a strong fish he hadhas caught. What makes the situation difficult is that noneneither of the two characters wants to give up. It becomes a fight about life or deathlife and death struggle.
          The excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist. He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and the nature. So he baresbears everything: the days and nights on the sea, without any food or water, the terrible summer sun, the being injured from keeping hold toof the line whereon which the fish is oncaught.
          The reader feels withfor him, wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up.
          Although this situation might not be very difficult or important for anybody else, it is for this old man and I found it very exciting to follow this story until it's quiet, sad end.",40.134761810302734,high

Unfortunately as soon as I camegot to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore.

          Yours Faithfully Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact this was the main cause ofreason for Mr White's resignation and suicide.

I could actually say that if it hadn't been for Mr. White she would have nevernever have passed her exam to enter University. Mr White came to our school when he was 40 year-oldyear oldyears old but still well-lookinggood-looking and all my girlsfemale school-mates fell suddenly in love with him; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any girlsgirl felt herself loved by him: Pat certainly was one of them. One day while she was walking in Central Park she saw a man and a young girl sitting under a tree. Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her class mateclassmateclassmates and she runran away as fast as she could. She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any exitationhesitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen. The next day Mr White was charged forwith abusesabuse and obliged to resign. The trial was long and hadreceived a wide coverage byfrom the media. We live in a small and old fashionedold-fashioned town and Mr. White was considered a monster: loosinglosing his job was hard for him, but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so, on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died, terrified by the darkness which was nearing.",41.21892929077149,high

          Firstly, the title 'International Arts Festival' is very suitable for the festival, because there werewas some variety of features in itthere. Next, Oneone reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is also a fantastic idea, because everyone could enjoy everything bywith thethat ticket.

While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world, they were from only six countries in factin fact only from six countries. The number of plays and films werewas also very fewsmall. In addition to that some concert halls were too small for the audience to enjoy the concerts.
          On balance, I feel that this annual festival can be even better next year. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you should collect artists and stars from more than six countries and rebuildbuild larger concert halls. I also suggest that more plays and films should be takentake place. I would be gratefulhappy to support you providing that you would likewant to make the festival more successful.

          At school, the most horrible one is about the school uniform. I really hate it, because we're not allowed to wear casual and fashonablefashionable clothes, colourful shoes andor colourful socks. We can't alsoAlso we can't turnchange our hair colour anand have to keep our hair length above our eye blowsbrowseyebrows. Next, we're not allowed to get driverdriver's licences which are for a motorbike and car as long as we'vewe're students. We're also not allowed to get part-time jobs. If possible, I want to change all of them.

          It's the same with the Internet and that's a very new thing. I send and receive more mailse-mails than letters! I can chat with my sister or friends without speaking when I'm working because it taketakes up just somea few minutes. With the Internet and, according to mein my opinion, the world is becomebecoming smaller and bigger at the same time. Smaller because I can visit an American library without leaving my desk and bigger because it seems to be endless.

doc2252.xml,Spanish,26-30,35.0,504,"Madrid, 17 - June - 2000 Dear SIR/MADAM, My name is ....I am workingwork as an actor for The Spanish Royal Theatre. I had spentspent the holewhole of last week in London with one of my colleagues. Sunday night we went to your theatre. We thought that going to the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"" waswould be (as you say in your advertisement) the perfect evening out and the perfect end ofto our stay in your city. But from the beginning we foundhad a lot of problems. Despite we arebeing actors we had to pay for a fullfull-price ticket because the discounts you promise are not available on Sundays. We tried to complain but the girl at the ticketsticket desk was very unpoliteimpolite. However, we decided to getgo intoto the show. Danny Brook is a good friend of mine and our purposeintention was to give him a surprise. You can imagine howwhat were our faces likeour faces were like when we saw that it was not Danny, but Peter Fox, who was on the stage. Nevertheless we decided to stay there till the end of the show and to takehave dinner in your restaurant, where we were supposed to meet some friends; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out. I am sure that the restaurant closed at its closing-hourclosing time but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late. As you can readAs you can see it was not our ""perfect evening out"" at all. I was really disappointed. I realize that managing a theatre is a hard work but I have to ask you for the money offor the tickets back. Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes onin the advertisement, before the starting timestart of the show. I am waiting for your answer, HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE?
          My composition is going to focus inon two main ideas: how the modern technology has changed my home life and how it affects my personal and professional life.
          Technology makes easier the work at homehouseworkhousework easier. I can't imagine how my life would be without a washing machine, a drier or a fridge. During the winter, when it is raining, you can have your clothes dry in less thatthan thirty minutes. That's fantastic.
          Technology has also been a great help in my everyday work. I am thinking mostly onof computers. Being a journalist I have to write lots of pages every day. The computer allows me to change my ideas without any effort and to store a biglarge amount of information in the minimum space.
          Also, the e-mail system is really hepfulhelpful. Thanks to the advanceinvention of the Internet I can contact lots of colleagues all around the world everydayevery day (and with the minimum cost). But, on my opinionin my opinion, the best thing is that I can stay at home or goinggo on holidaysholiday, and send my work to the office everydayevery day.",47.38550567626953,high
doc563.xml,Korean,21-25,32.0,461,"Dear Principal, First of all, we would like to thank you for the good programme which provides us with 3 daysdays' stay in London.  It contains a wide range of activities, for example, sightseeing, a river trip, visiting the science museum and gallery, shopping.  It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment. However, we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show, which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March.  The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes, such as the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make upmake-up and hairstyles etc.  Moreover, students are allowed to admitattend for free.
          All of us would like to attend the show because young people, particularly girls, are interested in fashion and make upmake-up, so we are expecting the show will beto be thea great opportunity to see what the new trendtrends in fashion will be like. It would be gratefulgreat if you givegavemade a little change in the programme so that we are able to attend the show.  It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th intoto the London Fashion and Leisure show, instead of the science museum and shopping.  I am looking forward to hearing from you. Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has considerably been changedbeen changed considerably by rapdilyrapidly developing mordernmodern technology.  To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woodswood to warm a room up and make food.  Since the eletricelectric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their lifelives have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend manymuch timestime on making food, washing up, or even on turning on anand off the lightthe light on and off.  Machines, such as athe dish washerdishwasher, laundry machinewashing machine and remote controllercontrol help us jutjust to relax or do a little work necessarynecessary work. From my point of viewIn my opinion, people's homehomes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devisedbuilt ininto every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connectingconnected to the owner.  He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a ""family"".  In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves. ComputerA computer might know bettermore than a human, but there are many things which it can notcannot replace in our life.",53.08163833618164,high

          Steve Galliano Our school, as it is well known, is a technical school and consequently theits daily life containsconsists of different activities performed in the classrooms or in the laboratories. A short video, showedshown to the English class, must take into account all these aspects of the life of our school. Here we can describe some lessons or other activities which can be filmed to createfor the video. The mathematicalmaths lessons are divided in two partparts: the theoretical one where the definitions and the theorems are presented to students and the numerical one where the problems are solved and the applications are explained. Two particular activities are performed in the laboratory of physics and in the laboratory of chemistrythe physics laboratory and the chemistry laboratory. In the former some of the most important physical laws are experimentally verified by the students with the help of an assistant. In the latter many chemical reactions may be reproduced to show to the students the resulting effects and the final compounds generated. These activities are very interesting and they will be surelysurely be enclosedincluded in the video.
          Moreover, many sportsports activities are performed in our school: swimming, tennis, gym, jogging and so on. Some parts of the final video may describeshow these additional features of the school.",55.3377799987793,high
doc2350.xml,French,16-20,35.0,617,"Dear Sir or Madam, I recently went to The Circle Theatre in order to see Over the Rainbow, and it has been quite deceiving. I am writing to you to complaintcomplain about five or six utterly outrageous facts. In the advertisement for the show, which I havehad picked up in the hall of the theatre, are therethere are about five points which were not respectedtrue. To begin with, as far as the starringcast is concerned, Danny Brook should have performed as the main character, and I saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not. Insofar as I came here especially to see him play, I have been very deceiveddisappointed, and this could be the understatement of the year, inasmuch as he is my favoritefavourite actor. Apart from itthat, the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! Could you explain to me the reasons offor such a huge latedelay? Thirdly, the ad mentionnedmentioned possible discounts. PersonnalyPersonally speaking, I didn't sawsee itthem and even didn'tdidn't even heardhear of itthem: I have askedasked about it, but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts. On top of that, the restaurant was closed for renovationsrenovation! How can you dare puttingputpublish an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know thatit is closed? To put it in a nutshell, and quite honestly, I would like to emphasize on the fact that I did not spentspendhave a ""perfect evening out"" at all, such as it iswas mentionnedmentionedpromised in the ad. For all these reasons, I would like, dear Sir or Madam, that you giveto give me my money back. I am looking forward to hearhearing from you. Yours faithfully, Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. If only Paul had knewknown itthat before...
          Everything had begunIt all began when Paul went downstairs ofin the Heavy Sleep. As he closed his eyes, he started to travel acrossalong the dark paths of his councienceconscience. He went through the valleys, plains and mountains of the Dream Landscape. He finally arrived in Faerie, a country of elder elves and strong white-bearded dwarves
          While he was wandering in the depths of the forest he felt a little tired and sat on a grey hugehuge grey stone, on the top of which he could stare across the whole woodswood.
          All of a sudden, a weird creature popped into his dream. She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree. Paul was wanderingwondering wetherwhether this beast could be offensiveaggressive when the creature said these words, ""I am glad to meet you, Paul."" The boy could not beleivebelieve to what he was hearing. How did the beast knewknow his name? ""You see, I am a mere product of your mind, but I would like to goget out of the Heavy Sleep. Please, bring me with you, ininto your reality!""
          At these words, Paul suddentlysuddenly awoke. Relieved, he thought that bringing the creature ininto his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie, and with it, threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape, when he heard a creepy sound under his bed. He jumped out of his room, locked the door and found his brother, Pat. He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat itthem.
          Unfortunately...one ourhour after that, a local zoo keeper arrived and caught the creature in order to put her in a cage. There she died because of she did not havinghave the Faerian food necessary tofor her survival.
          This is how humanmankind destroys what is good and burns the Woods of Dream. This is howwhy mankind can't be relied on. This is how secrets are betrayed, and the result of it.",59.13982391357422,high
